    * `fov`: The field of view (FOV) number.
    * `cell_ID`: Unique identifier for a single cell within a given FOV. 0 if background or unassigned molecules.
    * `x_global_px`, `y_global_px`: Global pixel coordinates relative to the tisse.
    * `x_local_px`, `y_local_px`: The x or y position (in pixels) relative to the given FOV.
    * `z`: Z-plane index representing the depth (optical section) where the transcript was detected.
    * `target`: Name of the target.
    * `CellComp`: Subcellular location of target.
