    * Column 1: Unique numeric index for each transcript within a field of view (non-consecutive, ascending).  
    * `barcode_id`: Zero-based index of the transcript barcode in the codebook; forms a composite key with `fov`.
    * `global_x`: Transcript x coordinates (µm) in the experimental region; may be negative due to alignment.  
    * `global_y`: Transcript y coordinates (µm) in the experimental region; may be negative due to alignment.  
    * `global_z`: The index of the z-position. The position is a zero-indexed integer.
    * `x`: The x-coordinate of the transcript (µm), within the coordinate space of the field of view.
    * `y`: The y-coordinate of the transcript (µm), within the coordinate space of the field of view.
    * `fov`: Zero-based field of view index; forms a composite key with `barcode_id`.  
    * `gene`: Gene name associated with the transcript.
