# cartloader

## Overview

Cartloader is a scalable, harmonized, and cloud-friendly pipeline for spatial omics data.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have revolutionized our ability to map molecular features with remarkable resolutionâ€”down to cellular and subcellular levels.  While the rapid development of sequencing-based platforms (e.g., Seq-Scope, Stereo-seq, Pixel-seq, 10x Visium HD) and imaging-based platforms (e.g., 10x Xenium, Vizgen MERSCOPE, CosMx SMI) has led to an explosion in the production of ST datasets across diverse tissues and species, this platform diversity has also introduced heterogeneous data formats and metadata schemas, which further obstruct efforts toward standardized data ingestion, cross-platform format conversion, and reproducible analytical workflows.

**Cartloader** is a harmonized, scalable pipeline for high-resolution spatial omics data processing and analysis with retaining the original resolution.
