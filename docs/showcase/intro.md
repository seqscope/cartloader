# Getting Started with `cartloader`

We offer a series of tutorials to help users get started with `cartloader`. For a more detailed explanation of each step in the pipeline, refer to our [Reference Pages](../step_by_step/sge_harmonization.md).

!!! warning "Requirement"

    Before getting started, please ensure that cartloader and all prerequisites are installed by following the [Installation](../installation.md) guide.

## Quick Start with a Single SGE Dataset

If you're new to the toolkit, we recommend beginning with the [Quick Start](./exampledat.md) tutorial. It uses a small mouse hippocampus dataset generated by SeqScope and walks through the full pipeline:  

1. SGE harmonization
2. Spatial factor inference with `FICTURE`  
3. Packaging outputs using `cartloader` for deployment.

This hands-on example is designed to help you validate your setup and get comfortable with each stage of the workflow.
